## Description:

My project is a trivia game used to expand and showcase my learned skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
It is also a way to not just test but, educate some Marvel movie buffs on some MCU knowledge. By the time the quiz is over, you should have gained some Marvel Movie substance.

## List of Features / User Stories:

When I started this project, my group member started off by making the decision to make this about something they were interested in. I was having some issues on deciding which game to choose, based upon difficulty and how to incorporate my interests at the same time. Once I decided to make this involve Marvel, I felt like the trivia game option allowed me to do both.

- there is a list of moderate level questions
- those questions will have an option A or option B choice to make
- interactive messages force users to actually get and learn the correct answer
- users will compete for a max score that is deployed at the end
- the ability to reset the game and try again will be available

## List of Technologies Used:

- Visual Studio Code
- Command Prompt
- Git Hub and Git Bash
- HTML, CSS, & Javascript
